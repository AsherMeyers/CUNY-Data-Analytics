/*9d:
Suppose you want to track changes over time in energy type preferences 
in New York City buildings. What information should you add to each table? 
What might a report that shows the trends over time look like?

Answer: I would add a field for 'date_added', the date when a given source
of energy was added to a building. 

Additional historical data on energy sources that were removed 
would make the tracking even more accurate. Eg, maybe the Bronx Lion
House used to run on grid electricity - I'd include the date when grid electricity
was removed.

A report of trends over time would show an increasing frequency of renewable
energy types; it would also show a greater number of energy types per building
as wind and solar are not feasible as an exclusive source of energy, at least
not without lots of expensive batteries. */
